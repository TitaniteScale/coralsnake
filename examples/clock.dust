# Simple Redstone Clock
# Defines one cycle: ON -> delay -> OFF -> delay

output clock_out
var tick_delay = 10 #Use a variable for delay

def run_clock():
    loop:
        activate(clock_out)
        delay(tick_delay)
        deactivate(clock_out)
        delay(tick_delay)

# You would also need a way to start the execution, maybe:
# call run_clock() # outside the def? Or assume first def runs?
# The interpreter doesn't handle this yet.

# NOTE: The CoralSnake syntax doesn't specify how to loop or repeat this cycle.
# This function defines only a single ON/OFF sequence.
